These are my [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][emacs]] configuration files. I use them with MacOS and a [[https://github.com/mclear-tools/build-emacs-macos][custom build
script]]. I typically build from the master branch (currently: GNU Emacs 29.0.50
(build 1, aarch64-apple-darwin21.4.0, NS appkit-2113.40 Version 12.3.1 (Build
21E258), git sha1 0a151b7c29) of 2022-05-06).

You are welcome to use any part of this configuration as you please, but I
recommend looking at [[https://github.com/Lambda-Emacs/lambda-emacs][Lambda-Emacs]], which is the framework on which this config
is built, if you want an easier way to exact whatever bits you find useful. 

I use Emacs primarily for all my academic work in the humanities (for
discussion of my view of text editors [[https://www.colinmclear.net/posts/texteditor/][see here]]) and the style of configuration
tends in that direction (rather than opposed to, e.g., a programming language
emphasis). I've tried to provide enough commentary on the configuration so that
it might be useful to those new to emacs or [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_editor][text-editors]] generally. 

One important thing to note is that the configuration uses [[https://wincent.com/wiki/Modal_editor][modal
]]keybindings---specifically [[https://github.com/meow-edit/meow][meow]]. I used [[http://www.vim.org][vim]] (or [[https://neovim.io][neovim]]) prior to emacs and I
think modal bindings are great. If you like vim bindings but don't tend to want
to think about configuring emacs, I strongly recommend [[http://spacemacs.org][spacemacs]] or [[https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs][doom-emacs]]
as a way of managing your configuration. For a more traditional emacs feel
there are also the configurations of [[Https://github.com/purcell/emacs.d][Purcell]], [[https://github.com/bbatsov/prelude][Batsov (prelude)]], [[https://github.com/seagle0128/.emacs.d][Zhang (Centaur
Emacs)]], and [[https://github.com/caisah/emacs.dz][many others]]. For a minimally sane setup you might also look at
some [[https://github.com/hrs/sensible-defaults.el][sensible defaults]]. My configuration is influenced by [[https://github.com/rougier][Nicolas Rougier's]]
work on [[https://github.com/rougier/elegant-emacs][elegant-emacs]] and [[https://github.com/rougier/nano-emacs][nano-emacs]]; see also the [[https://github.com/gilbertw1/bmacs][bmacs]] configuration of
Bryan Gilbert (see also his [[https://github.com/gilbertw1/emacs-literate-starter][literate starter kit]]) and [[https://github.com/novoid/dot-emacs][Karl Voit's]] config. Some
other good emacs starter kits to look at include John Kitchen's [[https://github.com/jkitchin/scimax][scimax]] and
Kieran Healy's [[https://github.com/kjhealy/emacs-starter-kit][social sciences starter kit]].

The advantage of meow, as I see it, is that it allows for broadly vim-like
modal editing without all the overhead of evil, or the tendency to override
(often in a somewhat sloppy way) vanilla-emacs bindings. I've tried to make
the current config "slimmer" than it has been in the past, in the sense of
relying, where possible, on built-in features of emacs (or on small packages
that leverage built-in emacs functions). For some useful tips on using some
potentially neglected built-in packages see [[https://karthinks.com/software/batteries-included-with-emacs/][here]] and [[https://karthinks.com/software/more-batteries-included-with-emacs/][here]].  

My config is based on a series of "[[file:.local/lambda-library/lambda-setup/][modules]]" loaded in the [[file:init.el][init.el]] file. Please
see the init file and the various config "helper" functions at the end for
easy navigation. While many like to use a literate org-file for organizing
their config I [[https://www.colinmclear.net/posts/emacs-configuration/][have reasons]] for preferring things in separate elisp files. The
modules are organized thematically rather than package by package (e.g. the
[[file:.local/lambda-library/lambda-setup/lem-setup-writing.el][writing module]] contains the config for spelling and markdown mode). Note that
while I have an [[file:early-init.el][early-init]] file for use with emacs 27+, the configuration
should work with emacs 26+ on MacOS (though I haven't tested this in awhile),
with the latest release (currently 28.1) being best.

Some highlights of this emacs setup include:

1. Short start up time -- emacs-init-time < 1 sec (though this may vary with
   your system)
2. Uses [[https://github.com/raxod502/straight.el][straight.el]] for package management
3. Modal editing with [[https://github.com/meow-edit/meow][meow]]
4. Comprehensive [[file:.local/lambda-library/lambda-setup/lem-setup-keybindings.el][keybindings]] using [[https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package/blob/master/bind-key.el][bind-key]] and [[https://github.com/meow-edit/meow][meow]], with spacebar as my leader key
5. Sensible [[file:.local/lambda-library/lambda-setup/lem-setup-settings.el][defaults]]
6. [[file:.local/lambda-library/lambda-setup/lem-setup-dired.el][Dired]] with sensible colors, settings, and useful extensions  
7. Completion with [[https://github.com/minad/vertico][Vertico]] and [[file:.local/lambda-library/lambda-setup/lem-setup-completion.el][related packages]]
8. My own [[https://github.com/Lambda-Emacs/lambda-themes][Lambda-themes]], which has four distinct light and dark variants
9. An attractive custom status-line -- [[https://github.com/Lambda-Emacs/lambda-line][Lambda-line]]
10. Extensive [[file:.local/lambda-library/lambda-setup/lem-setup-macos.el][MacOS integration]]
11. Single frame, [[file:.local/lambda-library/lambda-setup/lem-setup-tabs.el][tab-based]], [[file:.local/lambda-library/lambda-setup/lem-setup-projects.el][project]] workflow leveraging project.el and tab-bar (both
    built-in) with buffer-isolated [[https://github.com/mclear-tools/tabspaces][workspaces]]
12. A configurable [[file:.local/lambda-library/lambda-setup/lem-setup-splash.el][splash page]]
13. A [[file:.local/lambda-library/lambda-setup/lem-setup-writing.el][writing-centric]] configuration with great [[.local/lambda-library/lambda-setup/lem-setup-citation.el][citation support]], markdown, [[https://github.com/jgm/pandoc][pandoc]],
    dedicated [[.local/lambda-library/lambda-user/lem-setup-notes.el][functions for notes]], and [[.local/lambda-library/lambda-user/lem-setup-org.el][org-mode]]

    
For more information please take a look at the individual [[file:.local/lambda-library/lambda-setup/][configuration files]].
Please note that I'm by no means a competent programmer, so I'm sure there are
better ways of implementing many elements of this config. Suggestions are
welcome!
