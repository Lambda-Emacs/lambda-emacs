* ùõå-Emacs Features

ùõå-Emacs is a "modular" distribution of Emacs. It consists of a set of "setup"
elisp files grouped according to the following areas:

- *Core*: These files load essential libraries, useful functions, macros, and sane
  settings. This group of files consists of the following:
   + lem-setup-libraries
   + lem-setup-settings
   + lem-setup-functions
   + lem-setup-macros
- *UI*: Primary settings concerning frame, window, and buffer interaction, along
  with fonts, faces, themeing, completion, and navigation all belong to this group.
- *Writing & Editing*: Settings for spelling, citation, dictionary, notes,
  typesetting (LaTeX) and writing-specific modes (markdown).
- *Org*: Writing, Project management, TODOs, Literate programming. What doesn't
  org do? Since many people use Emacs almost exclusively for org-mode, it
  warrants its own group. 
- *Languages*: Programming languages. 
- *Shell*: Configuration for shell and terminal commands and applications
- *Project*: Version control settings and configuration for the built-in project.el
