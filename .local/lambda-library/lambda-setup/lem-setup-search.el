    (add-hook 'ag-search-finished-hook #'ag/jump-to-result-if-only-one-match)

    ;; Set default ag arguments
    ;; It looks like the ~/.agignore is used when launching ag from emacs too.
    ;; So the ignores from ~/.agignore don't have to be set here again.
    (setq ag-highlight-search t)
    ;; By default, ag.el will open results in a different window in the frame, so
    ;; the results buffer is still visible. You can override this so the results
    ;; buffer is hidden and the selected result is shown in its place:
    (setq ag-reuse-window nil)
    ;; reuse the same *ag* buffer for all your searches
    (setq ag-reuse-buffers t)
    ;; ;; To save buffer automatically when `wgrep-finish-edit'
    (setq wgrep-auto-save-buffer t)))

;;;; Deadgrep
;; Deadgrep uses ripgrep for extremely fast text searches and provides a
;; separate buffer for results.
(use-package deadgrep
  :bind (:map lem+search-keys
         ("g" . deadgrep)))

;;;; Ripgrep
;; Ripgrep is a replacement for both grep like (search one file) and ag like
;; (search many files) tools. It's fast and versatile and written in Rust.

;; Built-in library for cross-referencing
